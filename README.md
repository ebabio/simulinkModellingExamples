# Simulink Discrete Continuous Modelling

An internal project to perform some tests on how to model continuous plants with discrete controllers. This repo is in response to [ENGR-574](https://skydweller.atlassian.net/browse/ENGR-574) Jira ticket.

This will be done using a [Duffing system](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DuffingDifferentialEquation.html):
